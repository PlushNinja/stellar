# Adjustments are modifiers affecting the price of an adjustable object.
# Anything adjustable may have an adjustment that adds amount_cents to its
# price. The attached label provides detailed information.
# If an adjustment has an associated source, it should respond to
# `adjustment_label` that defines the contents of the label.
