#
# This migration changes history by adding transfers to existing
# shipments that were created before transfers were added.
#
# Since stock levels were changed through orders, they are left
# untouched by creating completed transfers without going through
# Transfer#complete! which would change the stock levels another time.
#
# The lot codes that were used to fulfil the orders have been lost,
# so transfer items are given the lot code "[legacy]".
