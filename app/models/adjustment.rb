# Adjustments are modifiers affecting the price of an adjustable object.
# Anything adjustable may have an adjustment that adds its amount to
# the price of the adjustable. Tax rate and inclusion of the adjustment
# is regarded identical to the adjustable.
# The attached label provides detailed information. If an adjustment has
# an associated source, it should respond to `description` that defines
# the contents of the label.
