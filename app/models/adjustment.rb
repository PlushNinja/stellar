# Adjustments are modifiers affecting the price of an adjustable object.
# Anything adjustable may have an adjustment that adds its amount to
# the price of the adjustable. The adjustable must respond to methods
# #tax_rate and #price_includes_tax? so that the adjustable can return
# its amount with or without tax.
# The attached label provides detailed information. If an adjustment has
# an associated source, it should respond to `description` that defines
# the contents of the label.
